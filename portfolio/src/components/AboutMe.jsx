      <p className='about-p'>I am a Minnesota native with a passion for the outdoors, technology, and sports. With nearly 13 years of marriage to my best friend, I am a proud father of two energetic boys. My professional interests revolve around technology, while Iâ€™ve also been a dedicated gamer for as long as I can remember. Outside of work, I enjoy coaching my sons' hockey teams, spending time at the cabin, and pursuing outdoor activities such as pheasant hunting and fishing.</p>
